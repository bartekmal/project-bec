This is a project for analysis of Bose-Einstein correlations in pPb collisions.

Software needed to produce ntuples:
https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/DaVinci/-/tree/phys-hbtCorrelations

Also needs Alexandria package for LHCb style management:
- update path in code/utils/Styles.C (software/utils/Alexandria by default)
- version used: commit ecfa662c81c59bf685749d6476bd57bc94cf1e6f.

Data is stored in the IFT WG area on EOS:
/eos/lhcb/wg/IonPhysics/analyses/bec_pPb_2013.
